An exploration into document classification, specifically focused on classifying whiskey reviews into their respective categories. The data consisted of whiskey reviews and their corresponding rating categories. The goal was to train a machine learning model to predict the rating category of a whiskey review.

The project involved several steps. First, the text data was cleaned to remove unwanted characters and standardize the text. This is a crucial step in any Natural Language Processing (NLP) task as it reduces noise in the data and makes it easier for the model to learn.

Next, we split the data into features and target variables. The feature was the text of the review, and the target was the rating category of the review.

We then constructed a pipeline that involved vectorizing the text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer, and then passing the vectorized data to a machine learning model. We experimented with different models, including RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBClassifier, CatBoostClassifier, and LGBMClassifier.

We also implemented a grid search with cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameters of the pipeline. This step was crucial in improving the model's performance.

In the latter part of the project, we experimented with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a technique for reducing the dimensionality of text data and uncovering hidden topics within it. We built a pipeline that first applied LSA to the data (by using a TF-IDF Vectorizer and TruncatedSVD), and then passed the transformed data to a classifier.

We also used Spacy to perform word embedding on the data and trained a RandomForestClassifier on the word vectors. The out-of-bag score of this model served as a proxy for the test score.

Finally, we explored sentiment analysis and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), two important concepts in NLP and machine learning, respectively.
